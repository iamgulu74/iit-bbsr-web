## 🤖 AI Assistance Summary

### 1. Architecture & Backend Engineering
- **Core Setup**: AI assisted in architecting the Express.js backend, defining the directory structure and service-oriented architecture.
- **NASA API Integration**: Collaborated on building the `NasaService` to interact with the NeoWS (Near Earth Object Web Service) API, including data parsing and error handling.
- **Security**: Guided the implementation of JWT-based authentication and BCrypt password hashing.
- **Dockerization**: Generated Dockerfiles and `docker-compose.yml` to ensure consistent development environments.

### 2. Frontend Development & UI/UX
- **Evolutionary Design**: The project transitioned from a Next.js/Tailwind prototype to a more refined **MDB5 (Material Design for Bootstrap 5)** implementation based on AI recommendations for design consistency.
- **Dynamic Content**: AI provided logic for rendering complex asteroid data, including orbital parameters, velocity, and miss distance calculations.
- **Animated Enhancements**: Assisted in developing custom CSS and JavaScript for visual effects like the `animated-bg.js` to enhance the space theme.
- **Page Implementation**: Generated the structure for key pages including the Dashboard, Asteroid Details, Orbit View, and Watchlist.

### 3. DevOps & Quality Assurance
- **Git Workflow**: Defined a professional Git branching and commit strategy following conventional commit standards.
- **Troubleshooting**: AI diagnosed and resolved build errors related to CSS autoprefixing and TypeScript type definitions.
- **API Optimization**: Provided suggestions for minimizing API calls through efficient data management.

### 4. Database Schema Design
- **Mongoose Modeling**: Assisted in defining schemas for Users and Asteroids, ensuring relational-like consistency in a NoSQL environment.
